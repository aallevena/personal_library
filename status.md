# Personal Library Web App

## Executive Summary
A family-oriented personal library management system built with modern web technologies. Enables book tracking, ISBN lookup, and library management with a clean, responsive interface. Fully deployed and operational in production.

**üöÄ Live Application**: https://personal-library-flax.vercel.app/
**üì¶ Repository**: GitHub integration with automatic deployments
**üèóÔ∏è Architecture**: Serverless Next.js application with managed PostgreSQL database

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (serverless functions)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (managed cloud database)
- **External APIs**: Open Library API for ISBN book data lookup
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **Development**: ESLint, TypeScript compiler, npm package management

### Core Features Implemented
- **Book Management**: Full CRUD operations with form validation and duplicate detection
- **User Management**: Full CRUD operations with inline editing and book reassignment on delete
- **Bottom Navigation**: Mobile-first tabbed navigation (Books, Users, Analytics)
- **ISBN Lookup**: Automatic book data population via Open Library API
- **Barcode Scanning**: Camera-based ISBN scanning for quick book entry
- **FastScan Mode**: Bulk book scanning with auto-add, duplicate detection, and live statistics
- **State Tracking**: Book status management (In library, Checked out, Lost)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first UI with Tailwind CSS and touch-optimized controls
- **Real-time Filtering**: Dynamic book filtering by status, owner, and possessor
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Live stats showing total books, users, and state breakdowns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with specific field-level messages
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Database-level UNIQUE constraint on ISBN+Owner combination

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT,
  publish_date DATE,
  summary TEXT,
  state TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (state IN ('In library', 'Checked out', 'Lost')),
  owner TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_possessor TEXT NOT NULL,
  times_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_read DATE,
  date_added DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  isbn TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(isbn, owner)
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Development History

### Phase 1: Project Setup ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. ‚úÖ Set up database connection architecture
3. ‚úÖ Design and implement database schema
4. ‚úÖ Configure Tailwind CSS for styling

### Phase 2: Core Backend ‚úÖ
5. ‚úÖ Create Open Library API service abstraction
6. ‚úÖ Build book management API routes (CRUD operations)
7. ‚úÖ Implement ISBN lookup functionality

### Phase 3: Frontend UI ‚úÖ
8. ‚úÖ Create book listing/library view component
9. ‚úÖ Build add/edit book form with ISBN lookup
10. ‚úÖ Implement book management (delete, update status)
11. ‚úÖ Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 4: Deployment ‚úÖ
12. ‚úÖ Set up Vercel deployment configuration
13. ‚úÖ Test production deployment  
14. ‚úÖ Document deployment process

## API Endpoints

### Books
- `GET /api/books` - List all books with optional filtering
- `POST /api/books` - Create new book entry (with duplicate detection)
- `GET /api/books/[id]` - Retrieve specific book details
- `PUT /api/books/[id]` - Update existing book
- `DELETE /api/books/[id]` - Remove book from library
- `GET /api/isbn/[isbn]` - ISBN lookup via Open Library API

### Users
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `GET /api/users/[id]` - Get single user
- `PUT /api/users/[id]` - Update user name
- `DELETE /api/users/[id]` - Delete user with book reassignment

### Utilities
- `GET /api/init` - Initialize/reinitialize database schema
- `GET /api/cleanup-duplicates` - Remove duplicate books (keeps oldest)

## Component Architecture
- **BottomNavigation.tsx**: Fixed bottom navigation with 3 tabs (Books, Users, Analytics)
- **BookLibrary.tsx**: Main library view with state management and filtering
- **UsersPage.tsx**: User management with table view, inline editing, and delete with reassignment
- **AnalyticsPage.tsx**: Stats dashboard with live metrics and coming soon features
- **BookCard.tsx**: Individual book display with inline editing
- **AddBookForm.tsx**: Modal form for book creation/editing with ISBN lookup
- **AddUserForm.tsx**: Modal form for user creation
- **BarcodeScanner.tsx**: Camera-based barcode/QR code scanner for ISBNs
- **FastScanModal.tsx**: Setup modal for FastScan mode with default values
- **FastScanScanner.tsx**: Bulk scanning interface with duplicate detection and statistics
- **Database Layer** (`lib/db.ts`): Centralized database operations (SQLite + PostgreSQL)
- **API Service** (`lib/openLibrary.ts`): External API abstraction for ISBN lookup

## Deployment Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Database connection strings configured in Vercel
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation with ESLint validation
- **Auto-deployment**: GitHub integration triggers builds on push
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Feature Backlog
*Use PL-XXX format for ticket tracking (e.g., PL-001, PL-002)*
- PL-5 #tech-debt Barcode Scanner: Remove timer-based workarounds in BarcodeScanner component. Replace setTimeout delays with proper React lifecycle hooks and state management to eliminate race conditions between React rendering and html5-qrcode library initialization.
- PL-8 #feature Analytics page - have a page showing total number of books + pie chart of read vs unread and utilization rate (books lent out + books read / total books)
- PL-9 #feature Add utilization rate to top of home page above where all the books are listed.
- PL-13 #feature Audit log for analytics: Capture events when status, owner, or possessor changes, or when read count is incremented.
- PL-15 #feature Search bar at the top for filtering on titles.
- PL-20 #bug Mobile: BookCard Edit/Delete buttons too small and could overlap with long titles.
